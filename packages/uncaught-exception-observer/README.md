# About

[Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) is a JavaScript implementation of a web browser without its graphical user interface. It includes many web standards from WHATWG [DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/) and [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/).

The goal of [Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) is to emulate enough of a web browser to be useful for testing, scraping web sites and server-side rendering.

[Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) focuses heavily on performance and can be used as an alternative to [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom).

This package contains a tool that can observe uncaught exceptions and Promise rejections in [Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom). It will dispatch uncaught errors as events on the [Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) Window instance.

Uncaught exceptions and rejections must be listened to on the NodeJS process at a global level. This tool will therefore not work in all environments as there may already be listeners added by other libraries on the NodeJS process that may conflict.

# Installation

```bash
npm install happy-dom @happy-dom/uncaught-exception-observer
```

# Usage

```javascript
import { Window } from 'happy-dom';
import { UncaughtExceptionObserver } from '@happy-dom/uncaught-exception-observer';

const window = new Window();
const document = window.document;
const observer = new UncaughtExceptionObserver();

// Connects observer
observer.observe(window);

window.addEventListener((error) => {
	// Do something on error
});

document.write(`
    <script>
        (() => {
            async function main() {
                await fetch('https://localhost:3000/')
                throw Error('This error will be caught, but would otherwise have terminated the process.');
            }

            main();
        })();
    </script>
`);

// Disconnects observer
observer.disconnect();
```
